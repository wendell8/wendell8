<h1 align="center">  Hello, World!

  <samp> I am a geophysicist graduated from the Federal University of Western ParÃ¡! It was in this institution that my life, in the world of programming, began. I was introduced to this wonderful and challenging environment through remote sensing. A priori I met a program, based on C and C+, MatLab. From there I learned how to structure code and how it works. After this first contact I was introduced to FORTRAN, and from then on I was attracted by the power of programming! Today I find myself solving my challenges, in geophysics, in Python. Well, in this language I find several opportunities to develop my calculations, being facilitated with the help of commoners who share their knowledge in their numerous libraries. Below I list several of them.
